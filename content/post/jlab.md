This is half a rant about a poor experience with JLab and half a review on the JLab Epic Air Buds Pro.

# Review 

I am not an audiophile or headphone/earbud geek. My standards are pretty low. My criteria for a pair of wireless earbuds is that they sound decent, have a reasonable battery life, and are not uncomfortable. 

For the past 2 years I've used a pair of [JBud Air Pro](https://www.jlab.com/en-ca/products/jbuds-air-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-black)s and thought they were mostly fine. The only thing I disliked about them was that the battery life was about 6 hours, which, when I used to work in a warehouse, meant that I would need to switch ears before the end of my shift. Other than that I had no complaints - they were worth the ~$70 that I paid and worked fine for two years. 

By contrast, I find the [Epic Air ANC](https://www.jlab.com/en-ca/products/epic-air-anc-true-wireless-earbuds-gen-2-black)s rather disappointing. The only area in which they beat the JBuds is battery life. Since I don't have a working charger for the JBuds, I can't do a direct sound comparison, but I can say that despite the Epic Air ANCs allowing you to customize the EQ setting via the JLab app, I can't get them to sound "right." I never had this issue with the JBuds, which offered no EQ customization. 

One of the features I liked a lot about the JBuds was the "Be Aware" mode. This is essentially the opposite of noise cancelling - it uses the microphone to allow noise through the earbuds. I particularly liked this for being out in public so I can still hear it people are talking to me. On the JBuds, I was able to have a conversation without needing to pause my music as long as it wasn't too loud. The Epic Airs have the same feature, but it doesn't work nearly as well. 

The noise cancellation seems fine. I've never owned another pair of ANC earbuds so I have nothing to compare it to, however I will say that a good pair of closed-back headphones beats the Epic Air ANCs any day. However, if I'm being honest, ANC is not actually something I am interested in whatsoever, so this isn't really a negative thing for me. 


# Rant

TL;DR JLab sent me 3 pairs of broken earbuds and I then ended up having to wait 3 months before being able to order the pair that finally worked. 

I'll preface this section by saying that the actual customer support agents provided excellent support. They consistently responded within 1-3 days and the actual return process was pretty simple and nice.

When I found out my JBuds charger wasn't working, I emailed JLab support asking for troubleshooting suggestions. They just said that they don't have any advice and that JLab batteries are irreplaceable. I dislike this as a business practice, but whatever, fair enough. 

Instead, they asked me to send my original receipt. It turned out that it was still under warranty (I actually lucked out here, it was less than 2 weeks from expiring).
