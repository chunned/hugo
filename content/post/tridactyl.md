Don't you find it annoying constantly having to move your hand from your keyboard to your mouse? With Tridactyl, you can use fancy modern websites without your hand ever leaving the home row.

# Why dislike mice?

Throughout 2024 my preferred IDE and general text editor became Neovim. I spent probably about a hundred hours over the year educating myself about it and frankly completely drank the Kool-Aid. I am now obsessed with Neovim and earnestly think that its community is one of the greatest of all open source software communities. 

The number one thing I love about Neovim is not having to move my hands from the keyboard. My wrist has been broken twice, and I find it quite straining to constantly move my hand to the mouse and back to the keyboard. Neovim inherits the core design principles from Vim and Vi before it; Vi was built before computer mice were commonplace and most computer users did everything by keyboard.

Beyond the practical dimension, I just find clicking things with the mouse to be dissasitfying and slow. Learning the Vim keybindings and flying through menial tasks at the blink of an eye is incredibly fun (to me). 

After spending most of 2024 kicking my old habits and building new ones suited to my Neovim workflow, I started to get really annoyed by my day-to-day browsing experience and how much I had to use the mouse for things that would be much faster and less taxing on the wrist if I could do them via keyboard shortcut. At first I considered setting up macros that would manipulate the cursor, but then I thought about how there is a Vim-mode plugin for every IDE, so I looked into Vim-mode plugins for the browser, and found Tridactyl. 

## Note for heathens (aka non-Firefox users)

Tridactyl is a Firefox-only extension. While I would love to go off on a tangent trying to convince you to use Firefox, to keep things on topic, I'll just say that there are some alternatives for Chrome. The best seems to be Vimium. I used it a little bit and it has all the basic features of Tridactyl, but is missing many of the more advanced ones. Vimium is available for Firefox as well.

# Tridactyl

Now we dive into the actual extension itself. Tridactyl comes with an easy to read tutorial, and I don't think it would be valuable to simply restate the things in the tutorial here. What I will do instead is discuss some of the common tasks I perform with Tridactyl to give you ideas on how you might use it.
