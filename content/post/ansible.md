From now on, I'm using Ansible for anything I plan on deploying long term.

This coming christmas marks exactly 5 years of me purchasing my first dedicated server to self host various services. In that time I have had to deal with quite a bit of rebuilding, both planned and unplanned, and it is always a scary experience. Even when you know what you're doing, it's very easy to make small mistakes that introduce small errors that cascade and are then hard to troubleshoot. 

The main benefit of Ansible is that it gives you an easy way to rebuild or migrate almost anything in a declarative manner. 

However, another benefit that I really like is that it serves as documentation for your entire stack.
