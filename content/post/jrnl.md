In this post we'll take a brief look at [Jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/en/stable), an open source journalling tool you can use right from the terminal. This post is the first in the series Cool Stuff, where I write short little posts about new projects I find that I think are cool.

I have tried to start journalling many times, and I've tried many different methods - both physical and digital. I was never really able to get into any of the traditional methods. When I found Jrnl a few months ago, I wanted to try it out, but kind of assumed that it would go the same way as all my past attempts and that I would forget about it in a few days after writing 1 or 2 entries. However, it seems that in Jrnl I finally found the perfect journalling method for me, and I now write in it multiple times a day.
