My name is Hayden and I like computers and music. Check out what I'm listening to on [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/user/chunned/). 

Right now I'm a student in the [Networking and IT Security program at Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/programs/undergraduate/computers-and-technology/information-technology-networking-and-information-technology-security/). 

I am also a part time SOC analyst at [eSentire](https://www.esentire.com) and a research lab assistant working on my own projects in the [ANTS lab](https://businessandit.ontariotechu.ca/ants/index.php) at Ontario Tech.

I've written a couple things:

- [blog (tryhackme): From Student to SOC Analyst: Haydenâ€™s Success Story](https://tryhackme.com/r/resources/blog/haydens-success-story)
- [blog (esentire): What I Learned from My SOC Analyst Internship at eSentire](https://www.esentire.com/blog/hayden-nolan-what-i-learned-from-my-soc-analyst-internship-at-esentire)
- [paper: Outcomes from the Use of a Security Information and Event Management Tool for Operational Technology in a Computer Security Exercise](https://event.fourwaves.com/65inmm/abstracts/8b8dafa6-7e36-4b8b-8dde-aebf92b6af34)
